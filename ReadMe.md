# Vekt Localizations

Welcome to the open repo for localising all strings for the iOS and watchOS app called [Vekt](https://vekt.app)

## Requirements and good to know

- Language needs to be supported in iOS and watchOS
- Xcode 13 and up is required from the mac App Store
- English is the base language
- DATE & PRICE are localised by iOS/watchOS

## How to add a new language

1. Add the supported languages section of this Read Me by adding the name of the language + yourself (if you want to be credited)
2. Create a PR and once approved a `.xcloc` file will be added and you will be notified
3. Continue with the steps bellow

## How to Improve existing strings

1. Create a Branch with the name of the language in the branch (e.g. `vekt-japanese-3.2`)
2. Open the `.xcloc` file in Xcode
3. Fill in all the improved translations
4. Commit the improved `.xcloc` file and create a PR
